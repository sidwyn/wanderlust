Spent quite a number of weeks on this for a grad school project (UC Berkeley Graduate School of Information Studies), so I thought I'd have it open-sourced. Won first place in the class (slides [here](http://cl.ly/1x0Q001v122H) if you're interested). This app is design-only, there is no engineering involved nor integration with APIs / services.

Proof-of-concept for a weekend getaway travel app. Code is not refactored nor organized well, since it was mostly just a hack to get things done up quickly.

If there's any questions regarding the app, feel free to contact me at sidwyn @ gmail.
